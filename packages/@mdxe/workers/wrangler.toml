# @mdxe/workers - Cloudflare Workers configuration
#
# This is an example configuration showing how to set up
# the Dynamic Worker Loader binding for MDX evaluation.
#
# The [[worker_loaders]] binding is a Cloudflare feature that allows
# dynamically creating and executing worker code at runtime.
# See: https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/worker-loaders/

# Required: Dynamic Worker Loader binding
# This binding allows evaluating MDX code in isolated worker instances
[[worker_loaders]]
binding = "LOADER"

# Note: The Dynamic Worker Loader is a special Cloudflare feature that
# may require specific account settings or enterprise features.
#
# Alternative approaches for local development:
# - Use wrangler dev (includes workerd runtime)
# - Use @mdxe/node for Node.js evaluation
# - Pre-compile MDX at build time and deploy static workers
