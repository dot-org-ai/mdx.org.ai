# Core Types

MDX.org.ai is built around a set of foundational types that define how content, code, and AI work together.

## Document Types

The base unit of content is the **MDXLDDocument** - combining YAML-LD frontmatter with MDX content:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Document](/Document) | Core document structure with typed frontmatter |

## AI Function Types

Functions define reusable AI capabilities:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Function](/Function) | AI function definitions with code, generative, agentic, and human variants |

## Agent Types

Autonomous AI agents that execute goals:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Agent](/Agent) | Autonomous agents with roles, goals, and team coordination |

## Workflow Types

Event-driven business logic:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Workflow](/Workflow) | Durable workflows with events, schedules, and the `$` context |

## Database Types

Schema-first data modeling:

| Type | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [Database](/Database) | Entity schemas with automatic bi-directional relationships |

## Type Discriminator Pattern

All typed content uses the `$type` field for discrimination:

```yaml
---
$type: BlogPost
$id: https://example.com/posts/hello
title: Hello World
---
```

This maps to JSON-LD `@type` and enables:
- Type-safe parsing and validation
- Schema.org compatibility
- Automatic routing and rendering
