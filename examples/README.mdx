# MDX Examples

This collection showcases example MDX applications built with the mdx.org.ai stack. Each example demonstrates different patterns for building AI-powered sites, APIs, databases, and agents.

## What's Here

These examples show how to build:

- **AI-powered APIs** - REST and GraphQL endpoints defined in MDX
- **Database interfaces** - Schema-first data access with automatic relationships
- **Content sites** - Documentation, blogs, and marketing pages
- **Agent workflows** - Multi-step AI workflows with human-in-the-loop
- **MCP servers** - Model Context Protocol integrations

## Getting Started

Run the development server to explore these examples:

```bash
pnpm mdxe:dev
```

Then open http://localhost:3000 to browse the examples.

## Structure

Each subdirectory is a self-contained example application with:

- `README.mdx` - Overview and documentation
- `app.mdx` - Application configuration
- `api.mdx` - API endpoint definitions
- `mcp.mdx` - MCP server configuration
- `docs/` - Documentation pages
- `[Type].mdx` - Dynamic route templates
