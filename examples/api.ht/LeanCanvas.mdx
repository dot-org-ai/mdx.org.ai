# Lean Canvas: api.ht

## Problem

1. **Documentation Gap** - APIs require separate documentation that's always out of sync
2. **Discoverability** - Finding the right endpoint requires digging through docs
3. **Developer Experience** - REST APIs don't self-describe; you need to read docs first

### Existing Alternatives
- Swagger/OpenAPI (still requires separate docs)
- GraphQL (complex, different paradigm)
- Manual documentation (always stale)
- Postman collections (not integrated with API)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **API-first startups** building developer platforms
- **Developer advocates** focused on DX
- **Solo developers** building side project APIs

### Mainstream
- **Backend teams** at SaaS companies
- **Platform teams** exposing internal services
- **Enterprise developers** building integrations

## Unique Value Proposition

**APIs You Can Click**

The best API documentation is no documentation—an API that describes itself when you navigate to it.

### High-Level Concept
"Hypertext APIs that browse like websites"

## Solution

1. **Self-Describing Endpoints** - Every URL returns HTML in browser, JSON for machines
2. **Clickable Navigation** - Browse your API like a website, follow links naturally
3. **Inline Documentation** - Docs are part of the response, not separate files
4. **Schema Autocompletion** - Clients get autocomplete from API responses

## Channels

### Free/Organic
- GitHub repository
- Hacker News / Reddit / dev communities
- API design blog posts

### Paid
- Sponsored developer newsletters
- API platform partnerships
- Enterprise sales outreach

## Revenue Streams

### Open Source (Free)
- Core framework MIT licensed
- Self-host anywhere

- Hosted API explorer
- Analytics and monitoring
- Custom branding
- Email support

### Enterprise ($299+/mo)
- Multi-team workspaces
- SSO/SAML integration

- Dedicated support

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Development team (2-3 engineers)
- Infrastructure (docs, demos)
- Marketing content

### Variable Costs
- Hosting for managed service
- Support staff time
- Conference/travel expenses

## Key Metrics

### Activation
- GitHub stars and forks
- npm downloads
- APIs created (first week)

### Engagement
- Weekly API requests served
- Developer retention (30-day)
- Documentation views vs. clicks

### Revenue
- Trial to paid conversion
- MRR growth
- Net revenue retention

## Unfair Advantage

1. **HyperText Philosophy** - Building on Tim Berners-Lee's original vision
2. **Browser Native** - Works everywhere, no special tooling needed
3. **MDX Integration** - Part of the broader content-as-code ecosystem
4. **Simplicity** - Removes abstraction instead of adding it
