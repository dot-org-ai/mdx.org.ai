# Core Concepts

HyperText APIs are built on simple principles that make them discoverable, self-documenting, and easy to use.

## Everything is a URL

Every resource has a URL that uniquely identifies it:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://api.example.com/users/alice"
}
```

URLs are:
- **Permanent** - They don't change
- **Shareable** - Copy and paste to share
- **Bookmarkable** - Save for later
- **Self-contained** - No context needed

## Links Connect Resources

Resources link to related resources using `$ref`:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://api.example.com/users/alice",
  "name": "Alice",
  "orders": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/users/alice/orders" },
  "organization": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/orgs/acme" }
}
```

Follow links to navigate:
- No need to construct URLs
- No documentation lookup
- Just click (or fetch) and go

## Start at the Root

Every API has a root that links to everything:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://api.example.com/",
  "users": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/users" },
  "products": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/products" },
  "orders": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/orders" }
}
```

From the root, you can discover:
- All available resources
- How to navigate
- What operations are available

## Self-Describing Resources

Resources include their type and schema:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://api.example.com/users/alice",
  "$type": "User",
  "$schema": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/schemas/User" },
  "name": "Alice"
}
```

Clients can:
- Understand the data structure
- Validate responses
- Generate forms automatically

## Collections are Resources Too

Collections follow the same pattern:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://api.example.com/users",
  "$type": "Collection",
  "items": [
    { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/users/alice" },
    { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/users/bob" }
  ],
  "count": 100,
  "next": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/users?page=2" }
}
```

Pagination is just more links:
- `next` - Next page
- `prev` - Previous page
- `first` - First page
- `last` - Last page

## Actions are Links

Operations are described as links with methods:

```json
{
  "$id": "https://api.example.com/users",
  "create": {
    "$ref": "https://api.example.com/users",
    "method": "POST",
    "schema": { "$ref": "https://api.example.com/schemas/CreateUser" }
  }
}
```

## Why HyperText?

1. **No Documentation Needed** - Follow links to discover
2. **No SDK Required** - Use any HTTP client
3. **No Breaking Changes** - Add links, don't change them
4. **No Coupling** - Clients don't hardcode URLs
5. **Works in Browser** - Click to navigate
