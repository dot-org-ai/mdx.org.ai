# StoryBrand Framework: todo.mdx.org.ai

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Developer learning MDX who wants to see a complete, working example of an AI-powered app.

**What do they want?**
- A real, working application to learn from
- Best practices demonstrated, not described
- AI integration patterns they can copy
- Something simple enough to understand completely

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I want to learn MDX but I need to see a complete application, not just snippets."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"Documentation only teaches concepts. I learn by reading real code."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
The best way to learn a framework is to study a complete, working application.

### The Villain
**Toy Examples** - Trivial code snippets that don't show how to build real applications.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built a complete, well-documented example app you can learn from and extend.

**Empathy:** We learn by reading code too. We built the example we wished existed when learning MDX.

**Authority:**
- Complete, working application
- AI integration included
- Every line documented
- Patterns you can copy directly

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Read
Study the code. Every file, every pattern, every integration is documented.

### Step 2: Run
Clone and run it yourself. See how it works in practice.

### Step 3: Extend
Add features. Customize it. Make it yours. This is your learning sandbox.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** View the Code

**Transitional CTA:** Read the Tutorial

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- Understanding MDX deeply
- Seeing AI integration in practice
- Having patterns to copy
- Confidence to build your own apps

**Transformation:**
From: Developer confused by MDX
To: Developer building confidently with MDX

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Learning from bad examples
- Reinventing solved problems
- Missing best practices
- Frustration from incomplete docs
