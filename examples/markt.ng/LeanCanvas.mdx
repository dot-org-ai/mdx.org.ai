# Lean Canvas: markt.ng

## Problem

1. **Execution Gap** - Marketing plans that never get executed
2. **Content Consistency** - Can't keep up with publishing schedules
3. **Multi-Channel Coordination** - Email, social, SMS all disconnected

### Existing Alternatives
- Mailchimp/Klaviyo (email only)
- Hootsuite/Buffer (social only)
- HubSpot (expensive, complex)
- Agencies (very expensive, slow)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **Solopreneurs** with no marketing capacity
- **Small business owners** wearing too many hats
- **Startup founders** focused on product

### Mainstream
- **SMB marketing managers** overwhelmed with channels
- **E-commerce operators** needing consistent campaigns
- **Service businesses** wanting to grow

## Unique Value Proposition

**Marketing That Runs Itself**

AI creates strategy, generates content, and executes campaigns on autopilot. Marketing that happens without your constant attention.

### High-Level Concept
"Autonomous marketing platform"

## Solution

1. **AI Strategy** - Tell us your goals, get a content calendar
2. **Content Generation** - Email, social, landing pages—all on-brand
3. **Omnichannel Execution** - Email, SMS, social coordinated
4. **Continuous Improvement** - A/B tests everything automatically

## Cost Structure

## Unfair Advantage

1. **True Automation** - Not templates, actual AI execution

3. **SMB Focus** - Built for small teams, not enterprise complexity
4. **AI-First Content** - Every piece AI-generated and optimized
