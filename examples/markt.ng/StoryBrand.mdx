# markt.ng StoryBrand

## One-Liner

---

## The Character (Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The **time-strapped business owner or solo marketer** who:
- Knows they need to market consistently but never have time
- Has tried tools that promise automation but still require constant attention
- Wants marketing that actually happens, not just marketing they planned
- Is tired of being the bottleneck in their own marketing

**What do they want?**

Marketing that runs itself. Campaigns that execute without babysitting. Results that compound while they focus on their actual business.

## The Problem

### External Problem (Surface-level)
Marketing requires constant attention—planning content calendars, writing posts, sending emails, analyzing results. It's a second full-time job.

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I know marketing matters, but I can't be a marketer AND run my business. Every week I promise to do better, and every week something more urgent comes up."

### Philosophical Problem (The "Should")
**Small businesses deserve big-business marketing.** You shouldn't need a marketing team to have consistent, professional marketing that actually works.

### The Villain
**The Time Tax.** Marketing's constant demand for attention that steals time from building your actual product or serving your customers.

## The Guide (Brand Positioning)

### Empathy Statement
We've started the week with ambitious content plans and ended it without posting anything. We've let marketing slide for "just one more week" that turned into months. We get it.

### Authority
- AI plans campaigns aligned with your business goals
- Automatically generates content across channels
- Learns what resonates with your audience
- Executes on schedule without reminders

---

## The Plan

### The 3-Step Process

1. **Tell Us About Your Business**
   Share your products, audience, and goals. AI builds a marketing strategy tailored to you.

2. **Review & Approve**
   See the content calendar, approve the direction. Adjust what you want, leave the rest to AI.

3. **Marketing Happens Automatically**
   Posts go out, emails send, campaigns run. You get reports, not homework.

### The Agreement Plan (Trust Builders)
- **Your Brand Voice**: AI learns and maintains your unique style
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Nothing posts without your approval (if you want it that way)
- **Full Transparency**: See every piece of content before and after it goes live
- **Continuous Learning**: Performance data improves future campaigns

---

## The Call to Action

### Direct CTA
**"Build Your Marketing Plan"** → AI creates a 30-day campaign in minutes

### Transitional CTAs
- "See Example Campaigns" → AI-generated marketing in action
- "Calculate Your Time Savings" → How much you'll save on marketing tasks
- "Talk to Our Team" → For larger organizations

---

## Success (The Transformation)

### Success Visuals

---

## Failure (Stakes)

**What happens if they don't act?**

- Competitors with consistent marketing build audience while you don't
- The "I'll do marketing next week" cycle continues forever
- Opportunities missed because no one knows you exist
- Growth stalls while you stay trapped doing everything yourself

---

## Brand Identity

### Voice & Tone
- **Reassuring**: "You don't have to do this alone"
- **Practical**: Real results for real businesses
- **Supportive**: A partner, not another tool to manage

### Key Messages
1. "Marketing automation that actually thinks."
2. "Your marketing, on autopilot."
3. "Stop planning marketing. Start doing marketing."

### Visual Identity
- **Color**: Professional blues and greens (trustworthy, growth)
- **Aesthetic**: Clean dashboards, content previews, automated flows
- **Imagery**: Marketing running in background, time reclaimed
