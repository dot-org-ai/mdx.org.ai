# StoryBrand Framework: writer.md

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Developer or Technical Writer who writes in markdown and wants AI assistance without switching tools.

**What do they want?**
- AI writing help in their natural environment
- Generate drafts from prompts or outlines
- Improve existing content effortlessly
- Stay in their terminal or editor

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I write in markdown but AI writing tools are all web-based with proprietary formats."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"Switching between my editor and a web AI breaks my flow. I just want to stay in my terminal."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
AI writing assistance should meet developers where they work, not force them into foreign environments.

### The Villain
**Context Switching** - The productivity killer of moving between your editor and web-based AI tools.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built the AI writing assistant for people who live in the terminal.

**Empathy:** We write in vim. We think in markdown. We built the AI writing tool we wanted to use.

**Authority:**
- Full CLI and editor integration
- Native markdown input/output
- Works with git workflows
- Used by [X] technical writers

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Install
One command installation. Works everywhere markdown does.

### Step 2: Generate
Turn prompts, outlines, or rough notes into polished markdown content.

### Step 3: Iterate
