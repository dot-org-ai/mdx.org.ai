# Lean Canvas: agents.mdx.org.ai

## Problem

1. **Reinventing Agents** - Developers rebuild the same agents repeatedly
2. **No Discoverability** - No way to find pre-built agents for common tasks
3. **Quality Uncertainty** - No standard for agent safety and reliability

### Existing Alternatives
- LangChain Hub (limited scope)
- GitHub search (no curation)
- Building from scratch (time-consuming)
- Vendor marketplaces (vendor lock-in)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **AI developers** building agent-powered apps
- **Agent builders** wanting to share their work
- **Companies** looking for pre-built capabilities

### Mainstream
- **Development teams** integrating AI features
- **Enterprise AI teams** evaluating agents
- **Agencies** delivering AI solutions

## Unique Value Proposition

**The npm for AI Agents**

Discover, install, and compose pre-built AI agents. Why build when you can install?

### High-Level Concept
"Agent registry and marketplace"

## Solution

1. **Searchable Registry** - Find agents by capability, use case, or integration
2. **One-Command Install** - `npx agents install @assistant/calendar`
3. **Quality Verification** - Safety testing and community ratings
4. **Composability** - Chain agents into workflows
