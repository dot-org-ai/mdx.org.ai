# Data Analyst

The Data Analyst agent turns natural language questions into insights. Ask "What were our top products last quarter?" and get charts, numbers, and explanations.

## Usage

```typescript
import { DataAnalyst } from '@agents/data-analyst'

const analyst = new DataAnalyst({
  model: 'claude-3-opus',
  database: postgresConnection,
  allowedTables: ['orders', 'products', 'customers'],
})

// Ask questions in natural language
const result = await analyst.ask(
  'What are the top 5 products by revenue this month?'
)

// Get visualizations
const chart = await analyst.visualize({
  data: result.data,
  type: 'bar',
  title: 'Top Products by Revenue',
})

// Generate reports
const report = await analyst.report({
  questions: [
    'Monthly revenue trend',
    'Customer acquisition by channel',
    'Product category performance',
  ],
  format: 'pdf',
})
```
