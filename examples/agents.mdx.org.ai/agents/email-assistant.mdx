# Email Assistant

The Email Assistant agent helps you manage your inbox efficiently—drafting replies in your voice, summarizing threads, and keeping important messages from getting buried.

## Usage

```typescript
import { EmailAssistant } from '@agents/email-assistant'

const email = new EmailAssistant({
  model: 'claude-3-sonnet',
  provider: 'gmail',
  voiceSamples: './my-writing-samples/',
})

// Draft a reply
const draft = await email.draftReply({
  threadId: 'abc123',
  instruction: 'Politely decline but suggest meeting next quarter',
})

// Summarize inbox
const summary = await email.summarize({
  since: '24h',
  highlight: ['urgent', 'requires-action'],
})

// Auto-organize
await email.organize({
  rules: [
    { from: '@company.com', label: 'Work' },
    { subject: /invoice/i, label: 'Finance' },
  ],
})
```
