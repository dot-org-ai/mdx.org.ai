# Calendar Assistant

The Calendar Assistant agent handles all your scheduling needs using natural language. Tell it "Schedule a meeting with Sarah next week" and it figures out the rest.

## Usage

```typescript
import { CalendarAssistant } from '@agents/calendar-assistant'

const calendar = new CalendarAssistant({
  model: 'claude-3-sonnet',
  calendar: googleCalendar,
  contacts: googleContacts,
})

// Natural language scheduling
await calendar.run('Schedule a 30-minute call with the engineering team tomorrow afternoon')

// Find available slots
const slots = await calendar.findSlots({
  attendees: ['sarah@company.com', 'john@company.com'],
  duration: 60,
  preferredTimes: ['morning'],
})

// Get schedule summary
const summary = await calendar.summarize({ days: 7 })
```
