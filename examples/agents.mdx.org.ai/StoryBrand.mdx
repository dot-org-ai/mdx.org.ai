# StoryBrand Framework: agents.mdx.org.ai

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The AI Developer who wants to build with agents, not build agents from scratch.

**What do they want?**
- Pre-built agents they can use immediately
- A way to share agents they've created
- Composable agents they can customize
- Trust that agents are safe and well-tested

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I need to add AI capabilities to my app but building agents is complex and time-consuming."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I feel like I'm reinventing the wheel. Surely someone has already built this agent?"

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
AI agents should be shared and reusable, not siloed and rebuilt from scratch by every developer.

### The Villain
**Fragmentation** - Thousands of developers building the same agents in isolation, with no standard way to share or discover them.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built the infrastructure for agent sharing so you can focus on agent using.

**Empathy:** We've spent months building agents that should have taken hours. We created the registry we wished existed.

**Authority:**
- Registry for 1,000+ pre-built agents
- Semantic search across capabilities
- Safety verification and testing
- Used by [X] developers worldwide

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Discover
Search the registry for agents that match your needs—by capability, use case, or integration.

### Step 2: Install
One command to add any agent to your project: `npx agents install @assistant/calendar`

### Step 3: Compose
Combine agents into workflows. Chain capabilities. Customize behavior.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Browse the Registry

**Transitional CTA:** Publish Your First Agent

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- Ship AI features in hours, not weeks
- Stand on the shoulders of the community
- Your agents help other developers
- Build a reputation in the agent ecosystem

**Transformation:**
From: Developer building everything from scratch
To: Developer leveraging a thriving agent ecosystem

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Weeks spent building agents that already exist
- Untested, unreliable agent code
- No visibility into agent capabilities
- Building in isolation

## 8. Brand Identity
