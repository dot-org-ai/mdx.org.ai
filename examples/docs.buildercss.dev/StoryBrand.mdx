**What do they want?**
- Clear, comprehensive documentation

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I want to use BuilderCSS but I need to understand how it works first."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I'm not sure if I'm using this framework correctly. Am I missing something?"

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
Great tools shouldn't require hours of documentation spelunking to use correctly.

### The Villain
**Incomplete Documentation** - The bane of every developer trying to learn a new framework.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)
