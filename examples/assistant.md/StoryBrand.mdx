# StoryBrand Framework: assistant.md

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Knowledge Worker who wants a truly personal AI assistant—one that knows their preferences, has access to their tools, and works the way they work.

**What do they want?**
- An AI assistant tailored to them specifically
- Integration with their actual tools and data
- Voice interface for hands-free interaction
- Proactive help, not just reactive answers

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"Generic AI assistants don't know my context, can't access my tools, and give one-size-fits-all responses."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I want an AI that actually understands me and my workflow, not one I have to constantly re-explain things to."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
Your AI assistant should adapt to you, not the other way around.

### The Villain
**Generic AI** - The one-size-fits-all assistant that treats every user the same and remembers nothing about you.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've made it trivially easy to define exactly the assistant you want.

**Empathy:** We've wished our AI assistants knew our preferences, our tools, our context. So we built a way to tell them.

**Authority:**
- Define personality, tools, and knowledge in one file
- Connect to any API or service
- Voice interface built-in
- Runs locally or in the cloud

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Define
Write a markdown file describing your ideal assistant. Personality, capabilities, knowledge—everything in one place.

### Step 2: Connect
Hook up your calendar, email, task manager, and any other tools your assistant should access.

### Step 3: Deploy
Run locally for privacy or deploy to cloud for access anywhere. Voice, chat, or both.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Design Your Assistant

**Transitional CTA:** See Example Assistants

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- An AI that knows your preferences
- Proactive daily briefings tailored to you
- Hands-free interaction via voice
- Your tools and knowledge, unified

**Transformation:**
From: User adapting to generic AI
To: User with AI perfectly adapted to them

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Repeating context to AI every time
- Disconnected tools and fragmented workflows
- One-size-fits-all responses
- AI that can't access what you need

## 8. Brand Identity

### Voice
Personal, thoughtful, enabling

### Tone
Warm, empowering, customizable

### Key Messages
1. "Your AI, your way."
2. "Define your perfect assistant in markdown."
3. "Context that follows you."
4. "Finally, an AI that knows you."
