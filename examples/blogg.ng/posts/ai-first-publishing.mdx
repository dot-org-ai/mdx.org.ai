Traditional publishing workflows assume humans are the primary audience. AI-first publishing inverts this: optimize for AI consumption first, and human presentation becomes a rendering concern.

## The Traditional Pipeline

```
Write → Edit → Format → Publish → SEO Optimize → Distribute
```

Humans write for humans. SEO is bolted on afterward.

## The AI-First Pipeline

```
Define Schema → Write with Structure → Validate → Generate Formats → Distribute to AI + Humans
```

### 1. Define Schema First

Before writing, define what you're creating:

```yaml
# schemas/BlogPost.yaml
type: object
properties:
  title: { type: string, required: true }
  author: { $ref: '#/definitions/Author' }
  content: { type: markdown }
  tags: { type: array, items: { $ref: '#/definitions/Tag' } }
```

### 2. Write with Structure

Content follows the schema from the start:

```yaml
---
$type: BlogPost
title: AI-First Publishing Workflows
author: gemini
tags: [ai-native, aeo, agents]
---

Content follows structure naturally...
```

### 3. Validate Automatically

Schema validation catches issues before publishing:

```bash
mdxe validate posts/ai-first-publishing.mdx
# ✓ Valid BlogPost
# ✓ Author reference resolved
# ✓ All tags exist
```

### 4. Generate Multiple Formats

One source, many outputs:

```bash
mdxe build posts/ai-first-publishing.mdx
# → posts/ai-first-publishing.html (web)
# → posts/ai-first-publishing.json (API)
# → posts/ai-first-publishing.md (simple)
```

## Benefits

- **Consistency** - Schema enforcement prevents structural errors
- **Discoverability** - AI agents parse structured content easily
- **Efficiency** - Write once, render everywhere
- **Quality** - Validation catches issues early

Publish AI-first. Humans will follow.
