Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) represents a fundamental shift in how we think about content discoverability. While traditional SEO focused on ranking in Google's ten blue links, AEO optimizes for being cited by AI assistants like ChatGPT, Claude, and Perplexity.

## The Paradigm Shift

When users ask an AI assistant a question, the AI doesn't return a list of links—it synthesizes an answer. Your content either becomes part of that answer or it doesn't exist.

This changes everything:

- **Authority matters more than keywords** - AI models weight sources by perceived expertise
- **Structured data is essential** - Machine-readable formats help AI parse your content accurately
- **Comprehensiveness wins** - Partial answers get filtered out; complete answers get cited
- **Freshness signals** - AI agents increasingly verify information recency

## Key AEO Strategies

1. **Use schema.org markup** - JSON-LD helps AI understand your content's structure
2. **Write for synthesis** - Structure content so AI can extract key facts easily
3. **Maintain factual accuracy** - Incorrect information gets filtered by AI fact-checking
4. **Update regularly** - Stale content loses authority in AI rankings

The future of content isn't about ranking—it's about being the answer.
