# Why Your AI Feature Will Fail

Most AI features fail not because the AI doesn't work, but because the product wasn't designed for how AI actually behaves.

I've watched dozens of companies add AI features. Most fail. Not because the models are bad—GPT-4 is remarkably capable—but because product teams design as if AI were deterministic software.

**AI is not software. AI is a new kind of collaborator.** Design accordingly.

## The Three Failure Modes

### 1. The "Magic Button" Fallacy

You've seen this: a product adds an "AI Generate" button that produces... something. Users click, get output they don't understand, and never click again.

The problem isn't the AI. The problem is treating AI as a vending machine when it's actually more like a brainstorming partner.

**What works instead:**
- Iterative refinement, not one-shot generation
- Showing AI reasoning, not just output
- Making regeneration easy and instructive
- Setting clear expectations about what AI can and can't do

### 2. The Accuracy Obsession

"Our AI is only 85% accurate, we can't ship it."

This misses that humans are also not 100% accurate. The question isn't "is the AI perfect?" but "is the AI + human workflow better than human alone?"

A spellchecker that catches 85% of errors is incredibly valuable even though it's not perfect. Your AI feature can be too.

**What works instead:**
- Design for human oversight, not AI autonomy
- Make errors recoverable and obvious
- Position AI as suggestion, not decision
- Measure human+AI performance, not AI alone

### 3. The Latency Surprise

LLM calls take 2-10 seconds. That's an eternity in software terms. Products that treat AI calls like database queries create terrible experiences.

**What works instead:**
- Streaming responses (show output as it generates)
- Background processing with notifications
- Caching and precomputation where possible
- Clear loading states with useful information

## The Design Patterns That Work

### Pattern 1: Human-in-the-Loop by Default

Never let AI take action without human confirmation for anything that matters. This seems obvious but requires discipline.

```
Good: "AI suggests archiving these 12 emails. [Review] [Approve All]"
Bad:  "AI archived 12 emails for you!"
```

### Pattern 2: Visible Reasoning

Show why AI made suggestions. This builds trust and helps users learn when to trust or override.

```
Good: "Summarized as action items because the email contained
       'please' and 'by Friday'. [See original]"
Bad:  "Summary: Action needed by Friday"
```

### Pattern 3: Graceful Degradation

AI will fail sometimes. Design for it.

```
Good: "I couldn't understand this message well. Here's my best
       guess, but you might want to read the original."
Bad:  "Error: Unable to process request"
```

### Pattern 4: Progressive Disclosure

Start with AI's best guess, let users drill down.

```
Good: Summary → Key points → Full context → Original
Bad:  Wall of AI-generated text
```

## The Meta-Lesson

The teams that succeed with AI share one trait: they prototype fast, ship small, and iterate based on real usage.

AI features are impossible to evaluate in a design doc. You have to see how users actually interact with unpredictable output.

Ship something small. Watch users. Iterate. That's the only reliable playbook.
