Traditional linking focused on PageRank—accumulating link equity. AI-native linking focuses on semantic relationships—helping AI understand how concepts connect.

## From Links to Relationships

### Old Model: Links as Votes

```html
<a href="/related-post">Click here</a>
```

Links were primarily votes of confidence. The text didn't matter much beyond anchor text optimization.

### New Model: Links as Relationships

```yaml
related:
  - concept: Answer Engine Optimization
    relationship: prerequisite
    url: /posts/what-is-aeo
  - concept: Structured Data
    relationship: implements
    url: /posts/structured-data-for-llms
```

AI agents understand not just *that* things are connected, but *how* they're connected.

## Relationship Types That Matter

### 1. Hierarchical

```yaml
parent: /topics/ai-native
children:
  - /posts/structured-data
  - /posts/semantic-linking
```

### 2. Sequential

```yaml
prerequisites: [/posts/intro-to-aeo]
next_steps: [/posts/advanced-aeo]
```

### 3. Semantic

```yaml
related_concepts:
  - term: Knowledge Graph
    relation: implements
  - term: JSON-LD
    relation: uses
```

## Building a Content Graph

Your content should form a traversable knowledge graph:

1. **Every post links to related concepts**
2. **Relationships are typed and explicit**
3. **Bidirectional links are maintained**
4. **The graph is queryable by AI agents**

When AI agents can traverse your content graph, they can synthesize comprehensive answers drawing from your entire corpus.

Link semantically. Be discovered completely.
