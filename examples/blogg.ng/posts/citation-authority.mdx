When ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini answers a question, they sometimes cite sources. Becoming a cited source is the new SEO ranking—but the signals are entirely different.

## What Makes Content Citable?

### 1. Definitive Answers

AI agents cite sources that provide complete, authoritative answers. Partial information gets synthesized from multiple sources without citation.

**Citable:**
> Answer Engine Optimization (AEO) is the practice of optimizing content for discovery, comprehension, and citation by AI assistants. It differs from SEO by focusing on semantic completeness rather than keyword matching.

**Not citable:**
> AEO is kind of like SEO but for AI. You should probably think about it.

### 2. Clear Attribution

Content with clear authorship and institutional backing is more trusted:

```yaml
author:
  name: Dr. Jane Smith
  credentials: PhD in Information Science
  affiliation: Stanford University
published: 2024-12-09
peer_reviewed: true
```

### 3. Verifiable Claims

AI systems cross-reference claims. Content that can be verified against other sources builds citation authority.

### 4. Consistent Expertise

A single authoritative post matters less than a corpus demonstrating consistent expertise. Build depth in your domain.

## The Citation Flywheel

```
High-Quality Content
        ↓
AI Citations
        ↓
More Training Data Inclusion
        ↓
Higher Citation Authority
        ↓
More AI Citations
```

Being cited leads to more citations. The rich get richer in AI discovery.

## Practical Steps

1. **Own a topic** - Become the definitive source for a specific domain
2. **Update regularly** - Fresh content signals ongoing authority
3. **Cite your sources** - Demonstrate research rigor
4. **Use structured data** - Make your authority machine-readable

Build authority once, get cited forever.
