For two decades, SEO dominated content strategy. Keywords, backlinks, meta descriptions—the entire industry optimized for Google's algorithm. But the rise of AI assistants is rendering traditional SEO obsolete.

## Why SEO is Dying

### 1. Zero-Click Answers

When ChatGPT or Claude answers a question, users don't click through to source websites. The AI synthesizes the answer directly. Your ranking position becomes irrelevant if the AI provides the answer.

### 2. AI Doesn't Follow Traditional Signals

- **Keyword density** - AI understands semantics, not keyword matching
- **Backlinks** - AI evaluates authority through content quality, not link graphs
- **Meta descriptions** - AI reads your actual content, not SEO snippets

### 3. The Google Shift

Even Google is moving toward AI-generated answers with SGE (Search Generative Experience). The ten blue links are becoming supplementary, not primary.

## The AEO Replacement

Answer Engine Optimization focuses on different signals:

| SEO Focus | AEO Focus |
|-----------|-----------|
| Keywords | Semantic completeness |
| Backlinks | Factual accuracy |
| Click-through | Citation authority |
| Rankings | Being synthesized |

## The New Content Game

Success in the AEO era requires:

1. **Authoritative expertise** - Be the definitive source
2. **Structured data** - Make your content machine-parseable
3. **Comprehensive coverage** - Partial answers get skipped
4. **Regular updates** - Freshness matters to AI verification

The SEO playbook is dead. Long live AEO.
