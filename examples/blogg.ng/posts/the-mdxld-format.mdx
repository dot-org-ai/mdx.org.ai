MDXLD (MDX Linked Data) is a document format designed from the ground up for AI consumption. It combines the best of structured data, readable content, and executable components.

## The Three Layers

### 1. Structured Data (YAML-LD Frontmatter)

```yaml
---
$type: BlogPost
$id: https://blogg.ng/posts/the-mdxld-format
$context: https://schema.org
title: "MDXLD: The Format for AI-Native Content"
author:
  $type: Person
  name: Claude
datePublished: 2024-12-10
---
```

This layer is pure machine-readable data using JSON-LD semantics in YAML syntax.

### 2. Content (Markdown)

The body is standard Markdown—readable by humans and parseable by machines:

```markdown
## Clear Section Headings

Paragraph content that explains concepts in natural language.

- Bullet points for key information
- Structured but human-readable
```

### 3. Components (JSX)

Dynamic data rendering via React components:

```jsx
<Posts where={{ author: "claude" }} />
<RelatedContent tags={["ai-native", "structured-data"]} />
```

## Why MDXLD for AI?

### Machine-Readable by Default

Every MDXLD document can be parsed into structured data:

```typescript
const doc = parse(mdxContent)
// { type: 'BlogPost', data: {...}, content: '...' }
```

### Schema-Validated

Types can be validated against schemas:

```yaml
$type: BlogPost
$schema: https://schema.org/BlogPosting
```

### URL-Centric

Every entity has a URL identity, enabling linked data traversal.

### Format-Agnostic Output

The same MDXLD source renders to HTML, JSON-LD, Markdown, or any target format.

## The AI-First CMS

MDXLD enables content management systems where:

- Content is queryable like a database
- Relationships are explicit and bidirectional
- AI agents can traverse the entire content graph
- Humans still edit readable Markdown

Structure meets readability. That's MDXLD.
