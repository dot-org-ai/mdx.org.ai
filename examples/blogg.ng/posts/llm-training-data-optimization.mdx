Every major LLM is trained on web content. If your content makes it into training data, your ideas become part of AI knowledge. This creates a new optimization target beyond traditional SEO.

## The Training Data Pipeline

```
Web Content → Scraped → Filtered → Deduplicated → Training → Model
```

At each stage, content can be:
- **Included** - Your information shapes the model
- **Excluded** - Your perspective is absent
- **Deduplicated** - Original sources win over copies

## Characteristics of Training-Worthy Content

### 1. Original Expertise

LLM creators filter for quality. Content demonstrating genuine expertise is prioritized over thin, SEO-optimized pages.

**Signals of expertise:**
- Technical depth and accuracy
- Novel information not found elsewhere
- Clear author attribution
- Consistent publication history

### 2. Clean, Structured Format

Training pipelines prefer content that parses cleanly:

```markdown
# Clear Heading Structure
## Consistent Hierarchy
### Logical Organization

- Bullet points for lists
- Code blocks for code
- Tables for structured data
```

### 3. Factual Accuracy

Incorrect information gets filtered. Training data curators cross-reference claims. Being factually correct increases inclusion probability.

### 4. Timeless Relevance

Training data snapshots are periodic. Content that remains relevant across time has more opportunities for inclusion than news tied to specific dates.

## The Long Game

Optimizing for training data is a long-term strategy:

1. **Publish consistently** - Build a corpus over time
2. **Be the primary source** - Don't just aggregate; create
3. **Maintain accuracy** - Update when things change
4. **Use stable URLs** - Help crawlers find and track your content

Your content today shapes AI knowledge tomorrow.
