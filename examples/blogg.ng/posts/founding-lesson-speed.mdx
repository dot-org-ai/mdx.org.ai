# The Founding Lesson That Changed Everything: Speed

My first startup failed because we were too slow.

Not too slow at shipping—we shipped plenty. Too slow at deciding, learning, and adapting.

We spent three months debating our go-to-market strategy. We spent six weeks perfecting a feature before showing it to users. We waited until we were "ready" to raise, missing a market window.

By the time we figured out what customers actually wanted, we were out of runway.

My second startup succeeded. The difference wasn't the idea, the team, or the market. The difference was speed.

## Speed Is Not What You Think

Speed isn't working 80-hour weeks. Speed is minimizing the time between "I wonder if..." and "now I know."

There are two kinds of speed:

**Execution speed:** How fast you ship code, close deals, hire people.

**Learning speed:** How fast you discover what works and what doesn't.

Learning speed matters more. A team that ships fast but never talks to users will build the wrong thing quickly. A team that learns fast will eventually build the right thing.

## The Speed Practices That Worked

### 1. Time-Boxed Decisions

We gave ourselves decision deadlines. Not because decisions made in 24 hours are better than decisions made in a week—they're usually the same quality—but because the cost of delay compounds.

"We'll decide the pricing model by Friday. If we're still uncertain, we'll pick our best guess and commit to revisiting in 30 days."

This sounds risky. It is risky. But indecision is riskier.

### 2. Minimum Viable Validation

Before building anything, we asked: "What's the smallest thing we can do to test this hypothesis?"

Sometimes the answer was a landing page. Sometimes a manual process. Sometimes just 10 customer conversations.

The goal wasn't to be certain before building. The goal was to be less uncertain for less effort.

### 3. Ship, Don't Perfect

Our rule: ship within two weeks of starting any project. If it couldn't be shipped in two weeks, break it into something that could.

This forced us to think smaller. "User authentication" became "email login only." "Dashboard redesign" became "update one chart."

Smaller scope meant faster shipping meant faster learning meant faster iteration.

### 4. Fast Feedback Loops

We showed work-in-progress to users constantly. Not polished prototypes—actual screenshots of half-built features.

"Here's what we're thinking. Does this solve your problem?"

Most of the time, it didn't. Better to learn that from a screenshot than from a shipped feature.

## What Slows Teams Down

The enemies of speed are subtle:

**Consensus seeking.** Waiting for everyone to agree means waiting forever. Disagree and commit.

**Perfectionism.** "One more iteration" is a trap. Ship it, see what happens, iterate later.

**Analysis paralysis.** More data rarely changes decisions. Decide with 70% confidence.

**Fear of failure.** Failures are cheap when you move fast. The expensive failure is never finding out.

**Complexity.** Every feature, process, and tool adds drag. Default to simpler.

## The Paradox of Speed

Here's what I didn't expect: moving faster actually reduced stress.

When you move slow, mistakes are catastrophic—you've invested so much that failure is unacceptable. When you move fast, mistakes are cheap—you haven't over-invested, so you can afford to be wrong.

Fast teams take more risks because the cost of being wrong is lower. More risks mean more learning. More learning means finding what works sooner.

Slow teams avoid risk because failure feels catastrophic. Fewer risks mean less learning. Less learning means taking longer to find what works.

Speed creates the conditions for success. Slowness makes success harder.

## How to Get Faster

If you want to increase your team's speed:

1. **Set deadlines for decisions.** Not "when we're ready" but "by Thursday."

2. **Ask "what's the smallest experiment?"** before every project.

3. **Ship things that embarrass you.** If you're proud of v1, you waited too long.

4. **Talk to users before you're ready.** Their feedback now is worth more than a polished product later.

5. **Measure cycle time.** Track how long it takes from "let's try this" to "now we know."

Speed is a muscle. It atrophies without exercise. Practice deciding fast, shipping small, and learning sooner.

Your startup will thank you.
