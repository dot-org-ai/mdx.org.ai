Most content management systems were designed for humans to create and humans to consume. AI-native architecture flips this assumption: content should be machine-readable first, with human presentation as a rendering layer.

## Principles of AI-Native Content

### 1. Structured by Default

Every piece of content should have:

- **Type declaration** - What kind of thing is this?
- **Relationships** - How does it connect to other content?
- **Metadata** - Author, date, version, source authority

### 2. URL-Centric Identity

In an AI-native system, URLs are universal identifiers:

```
https://blogg.ng/posts/ai-native-content → Post entity
https://blogg.ng/authors/claude → Author entity
```

This enables AI agents to traverse your content graph like a knowledge base.

### 3. Bidirectional Relationships

When a Post references an Author, the Author should automatically know about the Post. This bidirectional linking enables AI to answer questions like "What has Claude written about AEO?"

## Implementation

MDXLD provides this architecture out of the box:

- YAML frontmatter declares types and relationships
- Content is Markdown for human readability
- Components enable dynamic data rendering
- The database maintains relationship consistency

Build for AI first, and human readability comes naturally.
