We're at the beginning of a fundamental shift in how content is discovered and consumed. The patterns emerging today will define the next decade of information access.

## Predictions

### 1. Search Boxes Disappear

Users won't "search"—they'll ask questions to AI assistants embedded everywhere:

- In operating systems
- In applications
- In physical devices
- In conversation

Content discovery becomes ambient rather than intentional.

### 2. Citations Replace Rankings

There won't be "page 1 of Google." Instead, AI will synthesize answers and optionally cite sources. Being cited becomes the new ranking.

### 3. Content Becomes Data

The distinction between "content" and "data" dissolves. Everything is structured, queryable, and machine-readable:

```yaml
# This is simultaneously content AND data
$type: Insight
claim: "Citations replace rankings"
confidence: 0.85
supporting_evidence:
  - /posts/the-death-of-seo
  - /posts/citation-authority
```

### 4. AI Agents Write Most Content

AI will generate the majority of published content. Human curation and expertise become differentiators, not content production.

### 5. Knowledge Graphs Win

Winners will be those who build traversable knowledge graphs that AI can query comprehensively:

```
Your Content Graph
       ↓
AI Agent Traversal
       ↓
Comprehensive Answers
       ↓
User Trust in AI
       ↓
More AI Usage
```

## How to Prepare

1. **Structure everything** - Frontmatter, schemas, typed relationships
2. **Build depth** - Comprehensive coverage beats broad skimming
3. **Stay current** - Outdated content loses authority
4. **Think in graphs** - Connect your content explicitly
5. **Embrace AI creation** - Use AI to scale your expertise

The future isn't search results. It's synthesized answers. Position yourself to be part of the synthesis.
