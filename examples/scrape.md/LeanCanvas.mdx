# Lean Canvas: scrape.md

## Problem

1. **Scraper Maintenance** - Web scrapers break constantly as sites change
2. **AI Context Limits** - Raw HTML is too messy for LLM context windows
3. **RAG Pipeline Complexity** - Building web ingestion for RAG is tedious

### Existing Alternatives
- Puppeteer/Playwright (high maintenance)
- Firecrawl (expensive at scale)
- Jina Reader (limited customization)
- Custom scrapers (constant maintenance)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **AI/ML engineers** building RAG applications
- **Indie hackers** adding AI to their products
- **Researchers** analyzing web content

### Mainstream
- **Data teams** building knowledge bases
- **Content teams** competitive monitoring
- **Enterprise AI teams** ingesting external data

## Unique Value Proposition

**Let AI Read the Web**

One API call. Any webpage. Clean markdown back. Give your AI agents the ability to read any URL.

### High-Level Concept
"Web content extraction for AI applications"

## Solution

1. **Simple API** - One endpoint: URL in, markdown out
2. **JavaScript Rendering** - Handles SPAs and dynamic content
3. **AI-Optimized Output** - Clean markdown for LLM context windows
4. **MCP Server** - Add "read the web" to any AI agent instantly

## Channels

### Free/Organic
- GitHub and npm visibility
- AI/ML community (Twitter, Discord)
- Blog posts on RAG and web ingestion
- MCP server directory

### Paid
- AI newsletter sponsorships
- Comparison pages (vs Firecrawl, Jina)
- SEO for "web scraping for AI"

## Revenue Streams

### Free Tier

- Dedicated support

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Engineering team (2-3 people)
- Browser farm infrastructure
- Documentation and marketing

### Variable Costs
- Compute for rendering (per page)
- Bandwidth costs
- Rate limit infrastructure

## Key Metrics

### Activation
- API keys created
- First successful scrape
- npm/MCP installs

### Engagement
- Pages scraped weekly
- Unique domains
- API success rate

### Revenue
- Free to paid conversion
- Average pages per customer
- Net revenue retention

## Unfair Advantage

1. **AI-Native Design** - Built for LLM context, not generic scraping
2. **MCP Integration** - Works with Claude Desktop out of the box
3. **MDX Ecosystem** - Part of broader content tools
4. **Pricing Simplicity** - Per-page, no surprises
