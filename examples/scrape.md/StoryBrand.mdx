# scrape.md StoryBrand

## One-Liner

**Scrape.md turns any webpage into clean, structured markdown—so AI can read the web as easily as you do.**

---

## The Character (Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The **AI builder who needs web data** who:
- Is building AI applications that need real-world information
- Has fought with scraping libraries that break constantly
- Knows the data they need exists on the web, if only they could get it
- Wants clean, structured output—not messy HTML soup

**What do they want?**

To give their AI agents the ability to read and understand any webpage, without maintaining brittle scrapers or parsing nightmare HTML.

---

## The Problem

### External Problem (Surface-level)
Websites are built for humans, not machines. Extracting clean content requires fighting JavaScript rendering, anti-bot measures, and constantly changing HTML structures.

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I'm so close to building something amazing, but I'm stuck wrestling with HTML parsers and broken selectors. This isn't what I signed up for."

### Philosophical Problem (The "Should")
**AI should be able to read the web.** If humans can browse and understand any webpage, AI agents should have that same capability.

### The Villain
**Web Complexity.** The chaotic, ever-changing, JavaScript-rendered, anti-bot-protected mess that stands between AI and the information it needs.

---

## The Guide (Brand Positioning)

### Empathy Statement
We've spent countless hours debugging scrapers that worked yesterday but break today. We've parsed HTML that looks like it was designed by chaos itself. Never again.

### Authority
- Handles JavaScript-rendered content automatically
- Outputs clean, LLM-optimized markdown
- Respects robots.txt and rate limits by default
- Processes millions of pages reliably in production

---

## The Plan

### The 3-Step Process

1. **Point to a URL**
   Give us any webpage. We handle rendering, extraction, and cleanup.

2. **Get Clean Markdown**
   Receive structured content optimized for AI consumption. Headings, lists, links—all preserved.

3. **Feed Your AI**
   Use the markdown directly in prompts, RAG pipelines, or agent tools.

### The Agreement Plan (Trust Builders)
- **Ethical by Default**: Respects robots.txt, implements rate limiting
- **Consistent Format**: Same clean markdown structure every time
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful degradation when pages change
- **Transparent Pricing**: Pay for successful extractions only

---

## The Call to Action

### Direct CTA
**"Scrape a Page Now"** → Live demo that extracts any URL instantly

### Transitional CTAs
- "See Output Examples" → Sample markdown from popular sites
- "Browse Use Cases" → Real applications built with Scrape.md
- "Get the MCP Server" → Add web reading to any AI agent

---

## Success (The Transformation)

### Before
- Maintaining fragile scraping code
- Debugging broken selectors weekly
- Messy HTML in your AI prompts
- Blocked by anti-bot measures

### After
- One API call for any webpage
- Clean markdown every time
- AI that can "read" any URL
- Focus on building, not scraping

### Success Visuals
- Complex webpage → clean markdown side-by-side
- AI agent conversation showing web knowledge
- Dashboard showing successful extractions

---

## Failure (Stakes)

**What happens if they don't act?**

- AI agents limited to pre-packaged data
- Weeks lost maintaining scraping infrastructure
- Competitors build web-aware AI while you debug selectors
- User requests you can't fulfill because "the data is on the web"

---

## Brand Identity

### Voice & Tone
- **Practical**: "Here's the web, cleaned up for AI"
- **Reliable**: "It just works, every time"
- **Empowering**: "Give your AI the whole web"

### Key Messages
1. "Turn any webpage into AI-ready markdown."
2. "Web scraping, without the scraping."
3. "Let AI read the web."

### Visual Identity
- **Color**: Cool mist blue fading to white (clean, clear transformation)
- **Aesthetic**: Before/after transformations, clean data flows
- **Imagery**: Messy web → clean markdown, AI reading screens
