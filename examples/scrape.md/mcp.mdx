# MCP Server

Enable your AI agents to read and understand web pages.

## Installation

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scrape": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@scrape.md/mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Tools

### `scrape`

Fetch and convert a URL to Markdown.

```ts
{
  name: "scrape",
  description: "Fetch a webpage and convert it to Markdown",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      url: { type: "string", description: "URL to scrape" },
      selector: { type: "string", description: "CSS selector to extract" },
      format: { enum: ["markdown", "text", "html"], default: "markdown" }
    },
    required: ["url"]
  }
}
```

**Example:**

```
User: Summarize the article at https://blog.example.com/ai-trends-2024

Agent: I'll read that article for you.

[Uses scrape: url="https://blog.example.com/ai-trends-2024"]

Based on the article, here are the key AI trends for 2024:
1. Multimodal AI models...
2. AI agents and automation...
3. Edge AI deployment...
```

### `search_and_scrape`

Search the web and scrape top results.

```ts
{
  name: "search_and_scrape",
  description: "Search the web and scrape the top results",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      query: { type: "string", description: "Search query" },
      limit: { type: "number", default: 3, description: "Number of results to scrape" }
    },
    required: ["query"]
  }
}
```

### `extract_links`

Extract all links from a page.

```ts
{
  name: "extract_links",
  description: "Extract all links from a webpage",
  inputSchema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      url: { type: "string" },
      filter: { type: "string", description: "Filter links by pattern" }
    },
    required: ["url"]
  }
}
```

### `extract_data`

    type: "object",
    properties: {
      url: { type: "string" }
    },
    required: ["url"]
  }
}
```

## Usage Patterns

### Research

```
User: Research the latest developments in quantum computing

Agent:
[search_and_scrape: query="quantum computing breakthroughs 2024", limit=5]

Based on my research across 5 sources:

1. IBM announced a 1000+ qubit processor...
2. Google achieved new quantum supremacy milestone...
3. Startups are focusing on practical applications...

- https://nature.com/articles/quantum-breakthrough

```

### Comparison

```
User: Compare the pricing of Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare Pages

Agent:
[scrape: url="https://vercel.com/pricing"]
[scrape: url="https://netlify.com/pricing"]
[scrape: url="https://pages.cloudflare.com/pricing"]

Here's a comparison:

| Feature | Vercel | Netlify | Cloudflare |
|---------|--------|---------|------------|
| Free tier | 100GB | 100GB | Unlimited |
| ...
```

## Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "scrape": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["@scrape.md/mcp"],
      "env": {
        "CACHE_TTL": "3600",
        "RATE_LIMIT": "100",
        "JS_RENDERING": "true",
        "PROXY_URL": "http://proxy.example.com"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

1. **Cache results** - Set appropriate TTL to avoid re-scraping
2. **Respect robots.txt** - The MCP server respects site policies
3. **Rate limiting** - Built-in rate limiting prevents overloading sites
4. **Error handling** - Gracefully handles 404s, timeouts, etc.
