# StoryBrand Framework: readme.mdx.org.ai

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Developer with a great project but an embarrassingly incomplete README.

**What do they want?**
- A README that sells their project
- Accurate documentation of usage
- Beautiful formatting and structure
- Time to code, not write docs

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"My README is out of date and incomplete. I never have time to update it."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I'm embarrassed by my project's documentation. I know first impressions matter."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
Great code deserves great documentation, and developers shouldn't have to choose between them.

### The Villain
**Documentation Rot** - The inevitable decay of docs as code evolves, leading to inaccurate, unhelpful READMEs.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built AI that understands code and writes documentation humans actually want to read.

**Empathy:** We've shipped projects with "TODO: improve docs" in the README. We built this tool for ourselves.

**Authority:**
- AI analyzes your entire codebase
- Generates accurate usage examples
- Updates automatically on push
- Used by [X] open source projects

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Connect
Point at your repository. We analyze your code, comments, and existing docs.

### Step 2: Generate
AI creates a comprehensive README with installation, usage, API docs, and more.

### Step 3: Maintain
README updates automatically when your code changes. Always accurate, always current.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Generate Your README

**Transitional CTA:** See Example READMEs

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- A README that makes people want to use your project
- Accurate, up-to-date documentation
- Higher adoption and more stars
- Time back for actual coding

**Transformation:**
From: Developer with poor docs
To: Developer with impressive project pages

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Losing users to confusing setup
- Lower adoption due to poor first impression
- Outdated docs causing support issues
- Time wasted explaining usage manually

## 8. Brand Identity

### Voice
Efficient, encouraging, quality-focused

### Tone
Helpful, practical, polished

### Key Messages
1. "Great docs without the effort."
2. "AI writes. You code."
3. "READMEs that stay current."
4. "First impressions, automated."

## 9. What Gets Generated

### Sections
- Overview and description
- Quick start / installation
- Usage examples
- API reference
- Configuration options
- Contributing guide
- License

### Features
- Accurate code examples
- Syntax highlighting
- Badge generation
- Table of contents
- Changelog integration

## 10. Messaging by Audience

### For Open Source Maintainers
"Your contributors deserve good docs. Generate them in seconds, keep them current forever."

### For Teams
"Consistent documentation across all repositories. Automated, accurate, always up to date."

### For Solo Developers
"Ship projects you're proud of. Let AI handle the README while you handle the code."
