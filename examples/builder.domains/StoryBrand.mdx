# StoryBrand Framework: builder.domains

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The AI Builder who needs a domain for their agent, app, or project—right now, without the domain registration hassle.

**What do they want?**
- Instant domain for their AI agent or project
- Professional-looking address for free
- Option to scale to custom domains later
- No credit card, no hassle to get started

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I need a domain for my AI agent but I don't want to pay $12/year for every experiment."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"My agent feels less legitimate without a proper domain. But buying domains adds up fast."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
Every AI agent deserves an identity. Cost shouldn't be a barrier to building.

### The Villain
**Domain Friction** - The signup, payment, and configuration overhead that slows down every new project.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've acquired the domains so you can build without hesitation.

**Empathy:** We've registered dozens of domains for projects that never launched. We wanted domains to be free for experiments.

**Authority:**
- Premium TLDs like hq.com.ai, io.mw, llc.st
- Instant subdomain provisioning
- Automatic SSL and DNS
- Used by [X] AI agents worldwide

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Pick Your Name
Choose yourname.hq.com.ai or any available subdomain on our premium TLDs.

### Step 2: Deploy
Connect to your agent, app, or project. We handle DNS and SSL.

### Step 3: Scale
When you're ready, upgrade for custom domains or hundreds of subdomains.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Claim Your Free Domain

**Transitional CTA:** Browse Available TLDs

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- Every project has a domain from day one
- Professional identity for free
- Easy upgrade path when ready
- Focus on building, not admin

**Transformation:**
From: Builder hesitating over domain costs
To: Builder with instant identity for every project

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Projects delayed while choosing domains
