# Lean Canvas: headless.ly

## Problem

1. **Content/Code Disconnect** - Content lives in CMS, code lives in git, they're never in sync
2. **No Staging for Content** - Can't preview content changes with code changes
3. **CMS Lock-in** - Content trapped in proprietary databases

### Existing Alternatives
- Contentful (expensive, lock-in)
- Sanity (complex, separate system)
- Strapi (self-hosted but still separate)
- WordPress (monolithic, not git-friendly)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **JAMstack developers** wanting content in git
- **Technical content teams** comfortable with markdown
- **Agencies** building sites for clients

### Mainstream
- **Developer teams** at content-heavy companies
- **Marketing teams** with developer support
- **Documentation teams** managing technical content

## Unique Value Proposition

**Content is Code**

Version-controlled content that deploys with your code. Branch previews include content changes. No sync issues, ever.

### High-Level Concept
"Git-native headless CMS"

## Solution

1. **MDX Content** - Content stored as files in your repo
2. **Branch Previews** - Content changes branch with code
3. **Visual Editor** - Non-technical users edit through friendly UI
4. **AI Enhancement** - Generate, improve, translate with AI

## Channels

## Unfair Advantage

3. **No Vendor Lock-in** - Your content is always just files
4. **AI Integration** - AI writing built in from day one
