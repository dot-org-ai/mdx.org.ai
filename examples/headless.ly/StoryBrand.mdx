# headless.ly StoryBrand

## One-Liner

**Headless.ly is a headless CMS where content is code—version-controlled, branch-deployable, and enhanced with AI superpowers.**

---

## The Character (Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The **content-driven developer** who:
- Manages content for websites, docs, or applications
- Is tired of CMS platforms that don't fit developer workflows
- Wants content in git, not trapped in a database
- Needs AI to help create and manage content at scale

**What do they want?**

A CMS that works like code—branching, merging, reviewing—but with a great editing experience for non-technical contributors and AI assistance for creating content at scale.

---

## The Problem

### External Problem (Surface-level)
Traditional CMSes live outside your codebase. Content changes can't be PR reviewed, staged environments don't include content, and deployment is always separate from code.

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I have a beautiful git workflow for code, but content is this separate thing I have to manage differently. Why can't content be part of the same flow?"

### Philosophical Problem (The "Should")
**Content is code.** Content changes should be reviewed, staged, and deployed with the same rigor and workflow as code changes.

### The Villain
**Disconnect.** The artificial separation between content and code that creates parallel workflows, deployment nightmares, and content that's always out of sync.

---

## The Guide (Brand Positioning)

### Empathy Statement
We've managed content in WordPress while trying to maintain a modern development workflow. We've built custom markdown pipelines. We've wished content could just be... part of the repository.

### Authority
- Content stored as MDX files in your repository
- Full git history for every content change
- AI-powered content generation and enhancement
- Built-in editing experience for non-technical users

---

## The Plan

### The 3-Step Process

1. **Define Your Content Types**
   Create schemas for your content in MDX. Blog posts, docs, products—whatever you need.

2. **Edit Anywhere**
   Use the visual editor, your IDE, or AI generation. Everything commits to git.

3. **Deploy Together**
   Content changes deploy with code changes. Branch previews include content. No sync issues.

### The Agreement Plan (Trust Builders)
- **Git-Native**: Content lives in your repository, forever
- **Format Freedom**: MDX gives you markdown + components
- **AI-Enhanced**: Generate, improve, and translate content with AI
- **Zero Vendor Lock-in**: Your content is always just files

---

## The Call to Action

### Direct CTA
**"Connect Your Repository"** → Set up a content site in 5 minutes

### Transitional CTAs
- "Browse Templates" → Pre-built content structures
- "See the Editor" → Visual editing experience demo
- "Explore AI Features" → Content generation capabilities

---

## Success (The Transformation)

### Before
- Content in a CMS, code in git—never in sync
- Staging environments without latest content
- Content changes bypass code review
- Manual content migration during deploys

### After
- Content and code in the same repository
- Branch previews include content changes
- PR reviews for content like any other change
- AI helps create and improve content

### Success Visuals
- Git commit showing content + code together
- Branch preview with content changes
- AI generating blog post from outline

---

## Failure (Stakes)

**What happens if they don't act?**

- Continued content/code sync headaches
- Staging that never matches production
- Content changes that bypass review and cause issues
- Manual, slow content operations while competitors use AI

---

## Brand Identity

### Voice & Tone
- **Unified**: "Content and code, together at last"
- **Modern**: AI-enhanced, git-native
- **Practical**: Real solutions for real developer pain

### Key Messages
1. "Content is code."
2. "Branch your content. Merge your content. Deploy your content."
3. "Version-controlled content with AI superpowers."

### Visual Identity
- **Color**: Bright, energetic purples and blues (modern, intelligent)
- **Aesthetic**: Split views of content and code, git workflows
- **Imagery**: Editor interfaces, branch diagrams, AI generation
