# Features

MDX.org.ai provides a comprehensive set of features for building documentation and content-driven applications.

## Core Features

### Structured Data (YAML-LD)

Define typed, validated metadata with JSON-LD semantics:

```yaml
---
$type: Article
$id: /articles/hello-world
author: /authors/jane
---
```

### Unstructured Content (Markdown)

Write rich content with full Markdown support plus custom components.

### Executable Code (TypeScript)

Include TypeScript code that runs at build time or runtime:

```typescript
export const getStaticProps = async () => {
  const posts = await fetchPosts()
  return { props: { posts } }
}
```

### UI Components (React)

Use React components inline in your content:

```mdx
<Card title="Hello World">
  This is a card component
</Card>
```
