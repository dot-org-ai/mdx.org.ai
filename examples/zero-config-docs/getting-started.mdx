# Getting Started

Welcome to MDX.org.ai! This guide will help you get up and running.

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g mdxe
```

## Quick Start

1. Create a folder for your docs:

```bash
mkdir my-docs
cd my-docs
```

2. Create an `index.mdx` with `$type: Docs`:

```mdx
---
$type: Docs
$title: My Documentation
---

# Welcome to My Docs
```

3. Run the dev server:

```bash
mdxe
```

That's it! Your documentation site is now running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Next Steps

- Add more MDX files to create pages
- Customize with the `.mdx/` folder
- Deploy with `mdxe deploy`
