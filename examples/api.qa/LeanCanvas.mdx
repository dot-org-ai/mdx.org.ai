# Lean Canvas: api.qa

## Problem

1. **Test Coverage Gaps** - APIs ship with incomplete test coverage
2. **Maintenance Burden** - Tests break when APIs change
3. **Time Constraints** - Never enough time to write comprehensive tests

### Existing Alternatives
- Postman tests (manual creation)
- Jest/Mocha (manual, code-heavy)
- Contract testing (complex setup)
- QA teams (expensive, slow)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **Backend developers** who know they need more tests
- **DevOps engineers** wanting automated quality gates
- **Startup CTOs** with no QA resources

### Mainstream
- **Backend teams** at SaaS companies
- **Platform teams** maintaining API surfaces
- **QA automation engineers**

## Unique Value Proposition

**Test Everything. Write Nothing.**

AI analyzes your API and generates comprehensive tests. 100% coverage, 0% maintenance.

### High-Level Concept
"AI-powered API test generation"

## Solution

1. **OpenAPI Analysis** - Parse your spec, understand your API
2. **Test Generation** - AI creates tests for happy paths, edge cases, errors
3. **Continuous Monitoring** - Tests run on every deploy
4. **Self-Updating** - Tests adapt when API changes

## Channels

### Free/Organic
- GitHub Action marketplace
- Developer blog content on testing
- Backend developer communities
- SEO for "API testing automation"

### Paid
- DevOps newsletter sponsorships
- Postman alternative positioning
- CI/CD platform partnerships

## Revenue Streams

### Free Tier
- 5 endpoints
- Basic tests
- Community support

### Pro ($49/mo)
- Unlimited endpoints
- Full test generation
- CI/CD integration
- Priority support

### Enterprise ($299+/mo)
- Custom test scenarios
- Self-hosted option
- SSO/SAML
- SLA guarantee

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Engineering team (3-4 people)
- LLM infrastructure
- Test execution infrastructure

### Variable Costs
- LLM API costs per test generation
- Test execution compute
- Support time

## Key Metrics

### Activation
- APIs connected
- First test generated
- Tests passed

### Engagement
- Weekly test runs
- Bugs caught
- Coverage percentage

### Revenue
- Free to paid conversion
- Expansion (more APIs)
- Customer retention

## Unfair Advantage

1. **AI-Native Testing** - Not template-based, truly intelligent
2. **Self-Updating** - Tests evolve with the API
3. **OpenAPI Integration** - Works with existing specs
4. **Developer Experience** - CLI and CI/CD first
