# StoryBrand Framework: example.com.ai

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Developer starting a new AI-powered website who wants a solid foundation to build on.

**What do they want?**
- A production-ready starting point
- Best practices built in
- Easy customization
- Working examples to learn from

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I need to build an AI-powered website but don't want to start from scratch."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"Setting up a new project with all the right patterns takes forever. I just want to build features."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
Every new project shouldn't require reinventing the same boilerplate.

### The Villain
**Blank Canvas Syndrome** - Starting from zero every time, repeating work others have already done.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built the starter template we use ourselves for every new AI project.

**Empathy:** We've set up the same auth, the same API routes, the same AI integrations dozens of times. We packaged our best practices.

**Authority:**
- Production-ready architecture
- AI integrations pre-configured
- Best practices built in
- Used to launch [X] sites

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Fork
Clone the repository and customize the configuration.

### Step 2: Customize
Update branding, add your content types, configure your integrations.

### Step 3: Deploy
Push to production with one command. You're live.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Fork the Template

**Transitional CTA:** View Live Demo

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- Launching in days, not weeks
- Architecture that scales
- Best practices from day one
- Focus on features, not setup

**Transformation:**
From: Developer setting up boilerplate
To: Developer building unique features

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Weeks spent on setup
- Poor architectural decisions
- Security vulnerabilities from DIY auth
- Technical debt from shortcuts

## 8. Brand Identity

### Voice
Practical, educational, enabling

### Tone
Helpful, clear, empowering

### Key Messages
1. "Start with best practices."
2. "Fork, customize, ship."
3. "Skip the boilerplate. Build features."
4. "The foundation we wish we had."
