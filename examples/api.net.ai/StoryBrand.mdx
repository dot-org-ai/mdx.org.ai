# StoryBrand Framework: api.net.ai

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The Developer, Founder, or Creator who needs a backend API but doesn't want to spend days setting one up.

**What do they want?**
- An API running in minutes, not days
- Standard CRUD operations without boilerplate
- Database and authentication included
- API that scales automatically

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I need an API for my project but setting up a database, auth, and endpoints takes days."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I'm wasting time on infrastructure instead of building features."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
Standard APIs shouldn't require custom development every time.

### The Villain
**Backend Boilerplate** - The days of repetitive setup work before you can build anything interesting.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We've built the AI that turns descriptions into APIs.

**Empathy:** We've written the same CRUD endpoints hundreds of times. We built API.net.ai to never do it again.

**Authority:**
- Full REST/GraphQL API generation
- Database provisioned automatically
- Authentication included
- Scales to millions of requests

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Describe Your Data
Tell us what you're building. Define your models conversationally.

### Step 2: Watch It Generate
AI creates your complete API—endpoints, validation, database, auth.

### Step 3: Start Calling
Get your API URL and keys. Integrate with your app immediately.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Vibe Code Your API

**Transitional CTA:** See API Examples

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- Backend running in minutes
- Frontend connected same day
- No server management
- Scale without thinking

**Transformation:**
From: Developer stuck on backend setup
To: Developer building features on day one

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Days lost to boilerplate
- Database configuration headaches
- Auth implementation bugs
- Server management overhead

## 8. Brand Identity

### Voice
Efficient, developer-focused, liberating

### Tone
Practical, confident, time-respecting

### Key Messages
1. "Vibe code your API in minutes."
2. "Describe it. Deploy it. Call it."
3. "Skip the boilerplate forever."
4. "APIs that write themselves."

## 9. What Gets Generated

### API Features
- RESTful endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
- GraphQL alternative
- Input validation
- Error handling
- Rate limiting
- Auto-generated documentation

### Infrastructure
- PostgreSQL database
- Authentication (API keys, JWT)
- Auto-scaling
- SSL/HTTPS
- Global CDN

## 10. Messaging by Audience

### For Frontend Developers
"Stop waiting on backend. Vibe code your API and connect your frontend today."

### For Founders
"MVP backend in minutes. Focus on your product, not infrastructure."

### For Agencies
"Client APIs on demand. Bill for features, not setup time."
