# Airbnb

Airbnb began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to create a free Airbnb account so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world.

## The YC Story

The famous "Obama O's" story: To fund their startup, the founders sold cereal boxes during the 2008 election. This scrappiness impressed Paul Graham, who invited them to YC's Winter 2009 batch. They were one of YC's first mega-successes.

## Key Milestones

- 2008: Founded during the DNC in Denver
- 2009: Accepted into Y Combinator
- 2011: First international expansion
- 2020: IPO during the pandemic at $47B valuation
- 2024: Over 7 million listings worldwide

## Business Model

- Host listing fees: Free
- Guest service fee: 14-16%
- Host service fee: 3%
- Experiences platform for tours and activities

## Lessons Learned

1. **Do things that don't scale** - Founders personally photographed early listings
2. **Turn adversity into opportunity** - Pivoted during COVID to local stays
3. **Community is the product** - Trust between strangers enabled the platform
