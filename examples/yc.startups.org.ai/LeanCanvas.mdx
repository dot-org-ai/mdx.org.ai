# Lean Canvas: yc.startups.org.ai

## Problem

1. **Discovery Limitations** - YC directory search is basic and keyword-only
2. **Information Overload** - 4,000+ companies with no smart filtering
3. **Research Time** - Due diligence on YC companies takes hours

### Existing Alternatives
- Official YC directory (limited search)
- Crunchbase (generic, not YC-focused)
- LinkedIn (fragmented)
- Manual research (time-consuming)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **VCs and angels** investing in YC companies
- **Founders** researching competitors/partners
- **Job seekers** targeting YC startups

### Mainstream
- **Corporate development** teams scouting
- **Recruiters** sourcing from YC
- **Researchers** analyzing startup trends

## Unique Value Proposition

**Search YC Like You Think**

AI-powered exploration of Y Combinator companies. Natural language search, trend analysis, and insights.
