# Lean Canvas: db.ht

## Problem

1. **Admin Panel Overhead** - Every database needs a custom admin interface
2. **Data Inaccessibility** - Non-technical users can't explore database contents
3. **Schema Discovery** - Understanding database structure requires documentation

### Existing Alternatives
- Retool/Appsmith (expensive, complex setup)
- phpMyAdmin (ugly, technical)
- Custom admin panels (expensive to build/maintain)
- Spreadsheet exports (disconnected from source)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **Solo developers** who hate building admin panels
- **Startup founders** needing quick data access
- **Technical product managers** who want to self-serve

### Mainstream
- **Operations teams** needing data visibility
- **Support teams** looking up customer records
- **Small business owners** managing their data

## Unique Value Proposition

**A Database You Can Browse**

Every record is a URL. Click through your data like you click through a website. No admin panel to build.

### High-Level Concept
"The database that's also a website"

## Solution

1. **Browsable Records** - Every row has a URL, viewable in browser
2. **Relationship Links** - Foreign keys become clickable navigation
3. **Instant Admin** - CRUD interface generated automatically
4. **Search Built-in** - Full-text search across all tables

## Channels

### Free/Organic
- GitHub and documentation
- Developer blog posts
- Hacker News launches
- Word of mouth from frustrated devs

### Paid
- Database tool comparisons (SEO)
- Developer newsletter sponsorships
- Retool/Airtable alternative positioning

## Revenue Streams

### Open Source (Free)

### Cloud ($19-99/mo)
- Managed hosting
- Automatic backups
- Team access controls
- Priority support

### Enterprise ($499+/mo)
- Custom deployment
- SSO integration
- Audit logs
- SLA guarantee

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Engineering team (2-3 people)
- Infrastructure for cloud service
- Documentation and marketing

### Variable Costs
- Database hosting per customer
- Storage costs
- Support time

## Key Metrics

### Activation
- Databases connected (first week)
- Records browsed
- GitHub stars

### Engagement
- Weekly active users
- Records viewed/edited
- Team members added

### Revenue
- Free to paid conversion
- Expansion revenue
- Churn rate

## Unfair Advantage

1. **HyperText Philosophy** - Data as URLs, the way the web works
2. **Zero Configuration** - Point at database, get admin interface
3. **MDX Ecosystem** - Integrates with content-as-code tools
4. **Developer-First** - Built by devs tired of building admin panels
