# db.ht StoryBrand

## One-Liner

**DB.ht is a database you can browse—where every record has a URL, every relationship is a link, and your data is as navigable as the web.**

---

## The Character (Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The **data-forward developer** who:
- Manages complex data relationships across multiple systems
- Builds admin panels just to see what's in the database
- Knows SQL but wishes exploring data was more intuitive
- Believes data should be accessible, not trapped

**What do they want?**

A database that feels like browsing a website. Click a user, see their orders. Click an order, see its items. Navigate relationships by following links, not writing queries.

---

## The Problem

### External Problem (Surface-level)
Traditional databases hide data behind query interfaces. You need SQL knowledge, admin tools, or custom dashboards just to see what's in your database.

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I built this data model, but even I can't easily explore it. Every time someone asks 'can I see the data?', it's a project."

### Philosophical Problem (The "Should")
**Data should be as accessible as web pages.** If we can browse billions of web pages by clicking links, why can't we browse our own databases the same way?

### The Villain
**Silos.** The artificial barriers between data and the people who need it—forcing everyone through SQL, admin panels, or custom exports.

---

## The Guide (Brand Positioning)

### Empathy Statement
We've built the same admin dashboard for the hundredth time. CRUD operations that should be trivial become week-long projects. There has to be a better way.

### Authority
- Built on proven database technology (SQLite, Postgres, Turso)
- URL-addressable from day one—every record, every collection
- Automatic relationship navigation without JOIN complexity
- Battle-tested patterns from graph databases, made accessible

---

## The Plan

### The 3-Step Process

1. **Define Your Schema**
   Write `.mdx` files that describe your data types. Relationships are just links between documents.

2. **Store Your Data**
   Every record gets a unique URL. Collections are browsable. Relationships are navigable links.

3. **Browse & Share**
   Open your database in a browser. Click through relationships. Share URLs to specific records.

### The Agreement Plan (Trust Builders)
- **Standard Formats**: Export to JSON, Markdown, or SQL anytime
- **No Lock-in**: Your data stays portable, always
- **Permission Control**: URL-based access control that makes sense
- **Full Power Available**: SQL queries when you need them

## The Call to Action

### Direct CTA
**"Browse the Demo Database"** → Live, interactive database you can click through right now

### Transitional CTAs
- "See Schema Examples" → Common data models ready to use
- "Import Your Data" → Connect existing databases
- "Watch the Walkthrough" → 5-minute video tour

## Success (The Transformation)

### Before
- Building admin panels for every new data type
- Writing SQL for basic data exploration
- Explaining data relationships on whiteboards
- Exporting CSVs for non-technical stakeholders

### After
- Browse any record by its URL
- Navigate relationships by clicking links
- Share specific records as URLs
- Non-technical users explore data independently

### Success Visuals
- Browser showing a user record with clickable order links
- URL bar with readable record path like `/users/john/orders/123`
- Side-by-side: complex SQL JOIN vs. clicking a link

---

## Failure (Stakes)

**What happens if they don't act?**

- Another month building yet another admin dashboard
- Data remains trapped behind technical gatekeepers
- Stakeholders make decisions without seeing actual data
- Relationships stay hidden in foreign key columns

---

## Brand Identity

### Voice & Tone
- **Enlightening**: "What if databases worked like this?"
- **Democratizing**: Data access for everyone, not just DBAs
- **Technical depth, human surface**: Power under simplicity

### Key Messages
1. "A database you can browse."
2. "Every record is a URL."
3. "Click relationships. Follow links. Explore data."

### Visual Identity
- **Color**: Warm gradients (orange to gold) suggesting illumination
- **Aesthetic**: Clean data visualization, node-link diagrams
- **Imagery**: Connected records, browser navigation, data graphs

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Approach | Our Difference |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Traditional SQL | Query language required | Browse with clicks |
| Airtable | Spreadsheet interface | URL-native, developer-friendly |
| Firebase | Real-time, NoSQL | Relational + navigable |
| Hasura | GraphQL layer over Postgres | HTTP-native, browsable |

## Messaging Matrix

### For Developers
"Finally, a database you can browse without building an admin panel."

### For Teams
"Let anyone explore your data. Share records as URLs. Navigate relationships by clicking."

### For Data-Driven Organizations
"Make your data as accessible as your website—browsable, shareable, and understandable."
