# Lean Canvas: workflow.md

## Problem

1. **Scattered Automation** - Business logic lives in scattered scripts, cron jobs, and Zapier
2. **No Review Process** - Automation changes aren't code reviewed or tracked
3. **Tribal Knowledge** - Only the person who built it knows how it works

### Existing Alternatives
- Zapier/Make (no version control, limited)
- Temporal/Inngest (complex, developer-only)
- Cron jobs/scripts (scattered, undocumented)
- n8n (self-hosted, visual only)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **DevOps engineers** tired of scattered automation
- **Startup CTOs** wanting reviewable workflows
- **Technical founders** automating operations

### Mainstream
- **Engineering teams** managing business logic
- **Operations teams** with technical leads
- **Platform teams** standardizing automation

## Unique Value Proposition

**Automation That Reads Like Documentation**

Define workflows in markdown. Review them in PRs. Know exactly what happens and when. Git-native automation.

### High-Level Concept
"Workflows you can PR review"

## Solution

1. **Markdown Workflows** - Define automation in readable `.md` files
2. **Git-Native** - Version control, branching, PRs for all changes
3. **Event-Driven** - Trigger on webhooks, schedules, or custom events
4. **AI Steps** - Call Claude or any AI as a workflow step

## Channels

### Free/Organic
- GitHub and open source community
- DevOps blogs and podcasts
- Comparison content (vs Zapier, Temporal)
- Twitter/HN for launches

### Paid
- DevOps newsletter sponsorships
- Conference talks
- SEO for "workflow automation"

## Revenue Streams

### Open Source (Free)
- Self-hosted runtime
- All integrations included
- Community support

### Cloud ($49/mo)
- Managed hosting
- Execution history forever
- Team collaboration
- Priority support

### Enterprise ($299+/mo)
- Dedicated infrastructure
- SSO/SAML
- Audit logs
- SLA guarantee

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Engineering team (3-4 people)
- Open source maintenance
- Documentation

### Variable Costs
- Execution compute per customer
- Log storage
- Integration maintenance

## Key Metrics

### Activation
- Workflows created (first week)
- First successful execution
- GitHub stars

### Engagement
- Executions per week
- Active workflows
- Team members using

### Revenue
- Open source to cloud conversion
- MRR growth
- Customer retention

## Unfair Advantage

1. **Markdown Native** - Readable by anyone, not just developers
2. **Git Integration** - Built on git, not against it
3. **AI-First** - AI steps are first-class citizens
4. **MDX Ecosystem** - Part of content-as-code movement
