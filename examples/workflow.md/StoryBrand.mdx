# workflow.md StoryBrand

## One-Liner

**Workflow.md lets you define automation workflows in markdown—readable by humans, executable by machines, version-controlled like code.**

---

## The Character (Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The **automation-minded developer** who:
- Has workflows scattered across Zapier, n8n, custom scripts, and cron jobs
- Wants automation that lives in version control, not a web GUI
- Needs workflows that non-technical teammates can read and understand
- Believes business logic shouldn't be hidden in proprietary platforms

**What do they want?**

Automation that reads like documentation. Workflows you can PR review. Business logic that lives alongside your code, not in someone else's cloud.

---

## The Problem

### External Problem (Surface-level)
Business workflows are trapped in visual builders, proprietary platforms, or unmaintainable scripts. They're hard to review, impossible to diff, and break silently.

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I've built this fragile automation empire across five platforms. One wrong click and everything breaks. I can't even remember what half of it does."

### Philosophical Problem (The "Should")
**Automation should be readable.** If someone asks "what happens when a user signs up?", you should be able to show them a document, not a maze of connected nodes.

### The Villain
**Opacity.** The black boxes, visual spaghetti, and proprietary platforms that hide your business logic from view and version control.

---

## The Guide (Brand Positioning)

### Empathy Statement
We've clicked through node-based workflow editors at 2am trying to figure out why an automation stopped working. We've inherited workflows with no documentation because the documentation is... clicking around the UI?

### Authority
- Workflows defined in human-readable markdown
- Full git history—see exactly what changed and when
- Execute locally, in CI, or on Cloudflare Workers
- Integrates with everything that speaks HTTP

---

## The Plan

### The 3-Step Process

1. **Write Your Workflow**
   Define triggers, conditions, and actions in markdown. If you can write a README, you can write a workflow.

2. **Review & Deploy**
   PR review your automation like any other code. Deploy with git push.

3. **Monitor & Iterate**
   See execution logs, handle failures gracefully, and improve over time.

### The Agreement Plan (Trust Builders)
- **Git-Native**: Every change tracked, every rollback possible
- **Readable by Default**: Non-technical stakeholders can read workflows
- **Testable**: Write tests for your workflows like any other code
- **Portable**: No vendor lock-in, export and run anywhere

---

## The Call to Action

### Direct CTA
**"Write Your First Workflow"** → Interactive editor that runs a real workflow

### Transitional CTAs
- "See Workflow Examples" → Common automation patterns
- "Compare to Zapier" → Side-by-side workflow definitions
- "Import Existing Workflows" → Migration from visual builders

---

## Success (The Transformation)

### Before
- Workflows scattered across platforms
- No version history, no PR reviews
- "What does this workflow do?" requires clicking through a UI
- Silent failures with no debugging tools

### After
- All automation in version-controlled markdown
- PR reviews catch workflow bugs before production
- Anyone can read what happens when
- Execution logs and failure handling built in

### Success Visuals
- Markdown file showing clear workflow definition
- Git diff showing workflow change
- Execution trace with clear step-by-step logging

---

## Failure (Stakes)

**What happens if they don't act?**

- More workflows in more platforms, more complexity
- Critical business logic that nobody can explain
- Automation that breaks silently and stays broken
- Onboarding nightmares—"we'll show you the Zapier account"

---

## Brand Identity

### Voice & Tone
- **Clear**: "This is what automation should look like"
- **Principled**: Strong opinions about readable automation
- **Empowering**: "Your workflows, your repository"

### Key Messages
1. "Automation that reads like documentation."
2. "Git push your business logic."
3. "Workflows you can PR review."

### Visual Identity
- **Color**: Warm amber/gold (structured, illuminating)
- **Aesthetic**: Clean markdown, git diffs, clear flow visualization
- **Imagery**: Document to automation flow, PR review screens

## Competitive Positioning

| Competitor | Their Approach | Our Difference |
|------------|---------------|----------------|
| Zapier | Visual builder, hosted | Markdown, version-controlled |
| n8n | Self-hosted, node-based | Text-based, git-native |
| Temporal | Code-first, complex | Markdown-first, simple |
| GitHub Actions | YAML, CI-focused | Markdown, business-logic-focused |

## Messaging Matrix

### For Individual Developers
"Stop clicking through workflow UIs. Write automation you can read and review."

### For Engineering Teams
"Put your business logic in git. PR review your workflows. Deploy with confidence."

### For Technical Leaders
"Automation that your whole team can understand, not just the person who built it."
