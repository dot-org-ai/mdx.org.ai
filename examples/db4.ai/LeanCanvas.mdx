# Lean Canvas: db4.ai

## Problem

1. **Multi-Database Chaos** - Need Postgres + Pinecone + Redis for one AI app
2. **Embedding Management** - Manual embedding generation and sync
3. **Query Mismatch** - SQL doesn't work for semantic search

### Existing Alternatives
- Postgres + pgvector (bolted on, limited)
- Pinecone/Weaviate (separate system)
- Supabase + extensions (complex setup)
- Custom orchestration (maintenance nightmare)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **AI developers** building RAG applications
- **ML engineers** needing vector storage
- **Startups** launching AI features fast

### Mainstream
- **Backend teams** adding AI capabilities
- **Data engineers** managing AI pipelines
- **Enterprise AI teams** scaling applications

## Unique Value Proposition

**One Database. All of AI.**

Vectors and tables, together at last. Store data once, query with SQL, semantic search, or natural language.

### High-Level Concept
"AI-native database"

## Solution

1. **Unified Storage** - Structured and vector data together
2. **Auto Embeddings** - Embeddings generated automatically
3. **Multi-Query** - SQL + semantic + natural language
4. **Drop-in Replacement** - Works with existing ORMs

## Channels

### Free/Organic
- Developer community and GitHub
- AI/ML community content
- Database comparison articles
- Conference talks

### Paid
- AI newsletter sponsorships
- SEO for "vector database"
- Postgres alternative positioning

## Revenue Streams

### Free Tier
- 1GB storage
- 100K vectors
- Community support

### Pro ($49/mo)
- 50GB storage
- Unlimited vectors
- Team collaboration
- Priority support

### Enterprise ($499+/mo)
- Unlimited storage
- Dedicated infrastructure
- SLA guarantee
- Self-hosted option

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Engineering team (4-5 people)
- Database infrastructure R&D
- Documentation and marketing

### Variable Costs
- Cloud hosting per customer
- Embedding generation (if included)
- Support time

## Key Metrics

### Activation
- Databases created
- First query executed
- Data imported

### Engagement
- Weekly queries
- Data stored
- Feature usage (vectors vs SQL)

### Revenue
- Free to paid conversion
- Usage expansion
- Net revenue retention

## Unfair Advantage

1. **Purpose-Built** - Designed for AI, not adapted
2. **Unified Model** - No sync between systems
3. **Query Flexibility** - Multiple query paradigms
4. **ORM Compatible** - Works with existing tools
