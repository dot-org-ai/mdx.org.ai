# StoryBrand Framework: db4.ai

## 1. Character (The Hero)

**Who is our customer?**

The AI Developer who needs to store and query data in ways traditional databases weren't designed for.

**What do they want?**
- Vector search without bolting on extensions
- Semantic queries in natural language
- Embeddings stored alongside data
- Performance that scales with AI workloads

## 2. Problem

### External Problem (Tangible)
"I'm duct-taping vector databases to relational databases to SQL databases. It's a mess."

### Internal Problem (Emotional)
"I shouldn't need three different databases for one AI application."

### Philosophical Problem (Why It's Wrong)
AI applications deserve databases designed for AI, not legacy systems with AI bolted on.

### The Villain
**Legacy Databases** - Systems designed for the pre-AI era, forcing developers to awkwardly bolt on vector capabilities.

## 3. Guide (The Brand)

**Position:** We built the database we wished existed for AI applications.

**Empathy:** We've managed the pgvector + Pinecone + Redis + Postgres stack. We built DB4.ai to simplify everything.

**Authority:**
- Native vector search at any scale
- Semantic queries in natural language
- Automatic embedding generation
- One database for structured + unstructured data

## 4. Plan (The Path)

### Step 1: Connect
Drop in DB4.ai as your database. Works with your existing ORM and tools.

### Step 2: Store
Put your data in once. Embeddings generated automatically. No separate vector store needed.

### Step 3: Query
SQL, semantic search, or natural language. Query your data however makes sense.

## 5. Call to Action

**Direct CTA:** Start Building

**Transitional CTA:** See Query Examples

## 6. Success (What's at Stake)

**Success looks like:**
- One database for your entire AI app
- Fast vector search at any scale
- Natural language queries that work
- Less infrastructure to manage

**Transformation:**
From: Developer managing multiple databases
To: Developer with one unified data layer

## 7. Failure (What We Help Them Avoid)

**Failure looks like:**
- Complex multi-database architecture
- Slow vector search at scale
- Manual embedding management
- Data sync nightmares

## 8. Brand Identity

### Voice
Technical, confident, pioneering

### Tone
Bold, practical, forward-thinking

### Key Messages
1. "One database. All of AI."
2. "Vectors and tables, together at last."
3. "Query in English. Get real results."
4. "The database AI deserves."

## 9. Competitive Positioning

| Them | Us |
|------|-----|
| Postgres + pgvector | Native vector support |
| Separate vector DB | Unified storage |
| Manual embeddings | Auto-generated |
| SQL only | SQL + semantic + natural language |

## 10. Messaging by Audience

### For AI Developers
"Stop managing three databases. Build with one designed for AI from day one."

### For Data Engineers
"Unified data layer for AI workloads. Vector search, semantic queries, traditional SQL—all in one."

### For Startups
"Launch faster with the database that understands AI. No infrastructure gymnastics required."
