# Lean Canvas: agentic.md

## Problem

1. **Complexity Barrier** - Building AI agents requires deep knowledge of frameworks, LangChain, LlamaIndex, etc.
2. **Iteration Speed** - Testing and iterating on agent behavior is slow and cumbersome
3. **Deployment Friction** - Going from prototype to production agent is painful

### Existing Alternatives
- LangChain (complex, Python-focused)
- LlamaIndex (data-focused, steep learning curve)
- Custom implementations (slow, expensive)
- No-code builders (limited, vendor lock-in)

## Customer Segments

### Early Adopters
- **Solo developers** building AI-powered side projects
- **Startup CTOs** needing to ship agent features fast
- **AI hobbyists** experimenting with agent concepts

### Mainstream
- **Development teams** at SaaS companies adding AI
- **Agencies** building AI solutions for clients
- **Enterprise developers** with agent requirements

## Unique Value Proposition

**Write Markdown, Get Agents**

The fastest path from idea to deployed AI agent. No frameworks to learn, no complex configurations—just markdown.

### High-Level Concept
"The markdown-first agent framework"

## Solution

1. **Markdown Agent Definition** - Define agents in `.mdx` files with frontmatter
2. **Built-in Tool Library** - Pre-built integrations for common services
3. **One-Command Deploy** - `npx agentic deploy` ships to production
4. **MCP Server** - Agents work with Claude Desktop out of the box

## Channels

### Free/Organic
- GitHub repository and documentation
- Dev.to / Hashnode / Medium articles
- Twitter/X developer community
- Discord community

### Paid

- Self-hosted deployment is free
- Community support via Discord

### Hosted Platform ($49-499/mo)
- Managed agent hosting
- Monitoring and observability
- Team collaboration features
- Priority support

### Enterprise ($custom)
- Private cloud deployment

## Cost Structure

### Fixed Costs
- Core team salaries (3-5 engineers)
- Infrastructure (docs, CI/CD)
- Legal/compliance

### Variable Costs
- Cloud hosting for managed platform
- LLM API costs (passed through)
- Customer support

## Key Metrics

### Activation
- GitHub stars
- npm downloads
- Agents deployed (first week)

### Engagement
- Daily active agents
- Agents per user
- Tool usage patterns

### Revenue
- Free to paid conversion rate
- Monthly recurring revenue (MRR)
- Customer lifetime value (LTV)

## Unfair Advantage

1. **MDX Ecosystem** - Part of the broader mdx.org.ai platform
2. **Simplicity Focus** - While others add features, we remove complexity
3. **Community-Driven** - Open source creates network effects
4. **Markdown Native** - Version control, diffing, and review built-in
